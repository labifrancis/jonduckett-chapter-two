 <h1>God is able to bring your dreams to come to pass</h1>
 <p>Today is a great day to be prepared for your future</p>
 <p> Tags are known as markups. There are two types: structural and semantic markup</p>
 <h2>Structural Markup</h2>
 <p> These elements are used to describe headings and paragraphs</p>
 <h2> Semantic Markup</h2>
 <p> Examples are acronyms, quotes and emphasis, etc</p>
 <p> HTML has six levels of headings</p>
 <h1>This is the main heading</h1>
 <h2> This is the second heading</h2>
 <h3>This is the third heading</h3>
 <h4>This is the fourth heading</h4>
 <h5>This is the fifth heading</h5>
 <h6>This is the sixth heading</h6>
 <p> By default, a browser will show a paragraph on a new line, <b>This is how you make a text bold</b> and <i>This is how you italize a text</i></p>
 <h1>The Superscript and Subscript</h1>
 <p>This can be used for 4<sup>th</sup> and CO<sub>2</sub></p>
 <h1>White space collapsing and horizontal line</h1>
 <p> When a browser comes across tow or more spaces, it treats it like one space <br> I broke this line</p> <hr>
 <p> Tke your time, don't compare yourself with anybody. Make progress ebveryday. The only way to learn is to practice. With time, everything will be easy</p>
 <p> An empty element usually has one tag (no opening and closing tag) </p>
 <h1>Strong and emphasis</h1>
